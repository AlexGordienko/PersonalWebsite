        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6"></div>
    </div>

    <h4 style="margin-top: 100px">Prompt Chosen: Option 1</h4>
    <p>Design an experience for new students to browse, search, and propose new student organizations. Provide your overall process, a wireframe flow, and one to two screens at higher fidelity.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top: 100px">Phase I: Determining the flow.</h3>
    <p>An application to search and create clubs isn't particularly technically complex so the focus should be one making navigation as simple as possible, no matter what screen you are on. For this
    reason, functionality like search is accessible from any screen, no matter where the user is. Below is a rough breakdown of how the project would be structured. </p>
</div>

    <img src="../images/google/Project%20Structure@2x.png" style="width: 100%">
<div class="container">
<p>
        The three main pillars of the application: browse, details and create can be accessed one from the other. Pages that cause the user to leave the site (contact us and social) are accessible
        from the landing and details page, but less emphasis is placed on them throughout the design.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another critical phase of designing the flow was research of what other universities were doing in their own club websites.
        Many of the websites had an overabundance of information and a cluttered navigation system. Because of this,
        emphasis was placed on a clean and minimalist design and additional emphasis placed on making information on the club
        detail pages accessible. The goal was not to be super-fully-featured and full of bloat but instead make it simple
        for incoming students to find clubs that they would enjoy.
    </p>
    <h3 style="margin-top: 100px">Phase II: Constructing the core pages.</h3>
    <p>From here, the mission was to build the three main pages according to the spec above.</p>

    <h4 style="margin-top: 50px">The Landing Page</h4>
    <p>
        I started off by making the landing page. I found a color palette that I thought represented a university club
        fair well and defined colors for each type of club that I would make use of during the process: music, arts,
        sports, volunteering and social. Once this was done I put together some components that I hypothesized students
        would find useful into the following mockup.
    </p>
</div>
    <img src="../images/google/Browse@2x.png" style="width: 100%">
<div class="container">
    <p>
        A minimal page with some supporting color, contrasting search, a cheerful message and soft edges greets the user when
        they first load in.
    </p>
    <p>
        A central card pulls in their gaze with a coloured icon and a short description of campus clubs is displayed before
        the flanking cards (last year's most popular clubs) gives the user a good starting point to searching for the
        clubs based on the previous preferences of others.
    </p>
    <p>
        Below this, a tab bar gives the user the choice to filter which kinds of clubs they see. If no option is selected
        a list of all campus clubs are listed in alphabetical order. The view above shows the 'sports' tab selected
        with a little info card on the right hand side to talk a bit about sports at this school.
    </p>

    <h4 style="margin-top: 50px">The Details Page</h4>
    <p>
        This is the page that comes up whenever the user selects a particular club that they are most interested in.
        This page provides all of the information that the user needs about a given club, with more crucial information
        being placed at the top.
    </p>
</div>
<img src="../images/google/Details@2x.png" style="width: 100%">
<div class="container">
    <p>
        The most important thing to note here is the schedule of meeting times (or in this case training schedule) on
        the right side of the text. Several of the websites that I visited either did not have easily accessible
        meeting schedules or lacked them completely. As a student, being able to fit an activity into my schedule is
        often the deciding factor of whether or not I will attend an event.
    </p>

    <h4 style="margin-top: 50px">The Search Function</h4>
    <p>
        For search, it was critical to interweave the experience into the existing platform. For this reason, instead of
        making an entirely separate page I created an overlay that displays the needed information.
    </p>
</div>
<img src="../images/google/Search%20-%20Browse@2x.png" style="width: 100%">
<div class="container">
    <p>
        Since search is a fab, it persists through scroll. The important design decision here was to make the 'new club'
        button be inside the search feature. The reasoning here is to ensure that students have attempted to find similar
        clubs and join those before choosing to make their own. Having lots of clubs is great at a university, but what makes
        a good club is the attendance and members. This can, however, change - based on user testing and experiment results.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <a class="" download="" href="../GoogleDesignSubmission.xd" title=""> AdobeXD file</a> here and at the bottom of this page contains the full length mockup for search on the landing page as
        well as what search looks like on a club details page.
    </p>

    <h4 style="margin-top: 50px">Creating a new club</h4>
    <p>
        Clubs should be a good time and creating one should be fun! There shouldn't be a painful amount of required
        information or forms harder to navigate than the Arctic Ocean. For this reason, a simple form with three clearly
        outlined steps and every possible programmatic assistant is employed.

        The whole point of the form is to be super obvious and easy to use so there isn't much to add. But the buttons
        on every previous page are the color of the following page - so that's fun :)
    </p>

    <h3 style="margin-top: 100px">Phase III: Building and Testing.</h3>
    <p>
        This last section is equivalent to next steps: now that the mockups are done, how should we go about getting
        this platform to students asap?
    </p>
    <p>
        Before breaking out Webstorm and setting up Github repos galore, some peer review is in order to iron out any
        glaring issues right in the mockup software before touching the code. This can further be augmented by using
        prototyping tools to give the mockups 'functionality' and asking target users what they think of the experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have actually gone ahead and hooked all of that up in the <a class="" download="" href="../GoogleDesignSubmission.xd" title=""> AdobeXD file</a>
        if you would like to give it try!
    </p>
    <p>
        Once this is done and the design is as crispy as it's going to get, it's time to build it!
    </p>
    <p>
        The frontend can be built statically for the most part, the only tricky part would be the interaction
        design and fluidity of the search feature. However, for the search feature and automatic email sending and
        a myriad of other helpful features that the university might make use of, you would definitely need a backend.
        Express on Node is a good option and something NoSQL (MongoDB) is convenient since each club would just have its
        own record.
    </p>
    <p>
        The only reason you would want to use a stornger frontend framework (Angular, React, Vue etc) is if you
        were planning on building something more complex - like a dashboard for club leaders to manage their members,
        send out reminders and create public posts. In this case it would make a lot of sense to hook it all up as an SPA.
    </p>
