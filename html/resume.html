            <h4>MEAN Stack Developer at Explore Canada Immigration Services</h4>
            <hr>
            <p><i>June 2017 - Present</i><br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Explore Canada I was given the opportunity to completely redesign the company <a href="http://www.explorecanadaimmigration.ca" target="_blank"> website</a> from the ground up. Bringing my experience from
            previous projects built with the MEAN Stack as well as my cooperative and adaptable nature, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/manav-patel-b0686711b/" target="_blank">Manav Patel</a> and I constructed not
            only the company landing page but also a complex form processing app equipped with powerful logic and user friendly content.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Using Angular 4 and
            the Material 2 library we worked to build a thoroughly modern and impressive material design app while supporting the front-end with powerful and
            functional back-end. With Express.js, Node.js and Mongo DB we assembled a multifaceted back-end that utilized the latest in analytics, validation,
            mail api integration and accessible and scalable storage solutions. Furthermore the product that was delivered was not only optimized for speed and
            scalability but also optimized for SEO and was fully documented ensuring that future development could begin seamlessly. Currently I am continuing
            to optimize the site while adding new features and maintaining it.
            <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                While working at Explore Canada I learned a great deal about MEAN stack development, but among the most rewarding experiences of working at this start up
                was being able to focus on a strong product and work together towards a common goal. Constant back and forth with the CEO allowed for the implementation of an
                organizational structure that benefited both parties. Furthermore utilizing Agile Development practices (specifically through SCRUM) allowed the project
                to flow seamlessly and rapidly towards completion. Communication, hard work, teamwork and trust all played a large role in the production of the
                app and I left with organizational and interpersonal skills that could be applied to any organization no matter how big or small.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Recommendations given to me by my coworkers can be viewed <a href="#">here</a>.

            <h4>Self Employed Math Tutor</h4>
            <hr>
            <p><i>June 2017 - Present</i><br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the course of the summer I tutored six students from varying classes and of varying skill levels. I worked with students from
                grade 7, 8, 10, 11 and 12 to both review and reinforce the mathematics knowledge they had gained the previous academic year, filling in any evident gaps, while also
                advancing into the curriculum of the upcoming academic year. I approached each previous academic year with a problem solving mindset, working on different math topics
                and explaining topics until the student could comfortably solve problems on their own, identifying and executing the necessary steps. With new material I not only taught
                the students multiple methods to solve every problem while showing them solutions that the textbook would not, I also taught the student how to correctly handle and concatenate
                textbook material and utilize various other resources to augment their learning.
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having to go out and market my skills proved challenging but very constructive. I learned to focus on my strengths and reach out to potential clients and
                build strong relationships, allowing me to continue tutoring sessions with my clients not only throughout the summer, but also during the academic year. Communication, patience,
                preparedness and care is vital to effective tutoring and I worked hard to exemplify all of those qualities throughout my time as a tutor.

            <h4>Character</h4>
            <hr>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having the right disposition and team chemistry is crucial to the success of any company. An effective team is one that pushes for excellence even
            when excellence isn't expected. An effective team is one that works hard even when nobody is looking. An effective team is one that works together and takes responsibility
            together, not one that points fingers when something goes wrong.
            <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My personality allows me to mesh with a myriad of teams under a myriad or circumstances. I act as the glue and work to bring everything together,
            whether that means working out logistics or personally addressing issues that are outside my job description I strive to leave any team I join better than when I arrived.
            The characteristics below describe my professional nature:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>I possess excellent interpersonal and communication skills. Can both spearhead a project as well as work as a dedicated group member.</li>
                <li>Very strong work ethic and mature disposition. Project after project I demonstrate that I have what it takes to handle very challenging workloads with precise efficiency.</li>
                <li>Able to adapt quickly and manage a demanding workload effectively.</li>
                <li>Able to follow instructions carefully but take initiative and utilize creativity when asked.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>

            <h4>Communication</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>Communication is vital in any and every circumstance. For this reason I devote time to the study of language. Communication is the key to understanding and my knowledge of
                language helps to broaden my ability to communicate effectively.
                I am currently fluent in:
            <ol>
                <li>English</li>
                <li>French</li>
                <li>Russian</li>
            </ol>
            I have furthermore been studying <b>Chinese</b> for three years and intend to continue to grow in this area.
